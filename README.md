# New Church Evangelism Fellowship (NCEF) - Landing Page

## Project Overview  
This is a landing page developed for the New Church Evangelism Fellowship (NCEF), a non-profit organization dedicated to planting and supporting Christian churches across the Midwest. The organization hired me to create an engaging and user-friendly web presence to showcase their mission, success stories, and ways for supporters to get involved.

Currently, we are in the process of adding more features and securing a custom domain to make the site even more accessible and professional.

## Features Implemented  
- Modern, responsive landing page highlighting NCEFâ€™s mission and impact  
- User-friendly navigation with structured sections:  
  - About NCEF  
  - What We Do  
  - Success Stories  
  - Get Involved  
  - Contact Us  
- Image-driven design to enhance engagement and storytelling  
- Optimized for GitHub Pages deployment, with plans for a custom domain soon  

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling  
- JavaScript for interactive elements  
- GitHub Pages for hosting and deployment  

## What I Learned  

### Product Management and Client Communication  
- Worked directly with the NCEF team to understand their vision and goals  
- Managed feedback cycles and iterated based on user needs and client expectations  

### User Experience (UX) and Accessibility  
- Focused on designing a clean, readable, and engaging user experience for potential donors and church leaders  
- Ensured mobile responsiveness so the site works well on all devices  

### Hosting and Deployment Strategies  
- Researched and tested various free and paid hosting options including GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Cloudflare  
- Preparing for custom domain integration to make the site more professional  

## Next Steps  
- Domain registration to transition from GitHub Pages to a custom ncef.org domain  
- Feature expansion, including donation options and a church locator  
- Performance optimization to enhance loading speeds and mobile experience
